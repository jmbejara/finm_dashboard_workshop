# From Data to Dashboard: Building Interactive Financial Visualizations in Python

Turn your financial analyses into interactive web dashboards that look as polished as the insights they communicate. This two-day workshop gives students with foundational Python experience the structure, support, and hands-on time they need to source data, prototype compelling visuals, and publish a shareable dashboard.

## Workshop Overview

- **Instructor:** Jeremy Bejarano
- **Email:** jbejarano@uchicago.edu
- **Audience:** Students comfortable with basic Python who want to level up their data storytelling and presentation skills.
- **Tools:** Python, WRDS for data access, Streamlit for interactive dashboards, plus supporting open-source visualization libraries.
- **Format:** Each day alternates focused lectures with guided breakout sessions so you can immediately apply what you learn. Expect plenty of time for questions and in-the-room troubleshooting.

## What You'll Learn

- Pulling and wrangling financial datasets from the Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS) platform.
- Designing visual narratives that highlight the story behind your analysis.
- Building interactive dashboards in Streamlit that you can run locally or publish to the web.
- Packaging your work so that stakeholders can navigate, explore, and trust your results.

## Detailed Schedule

### Monday, September 22
- 12:00 â€“ 1:30 pm Â· Discussion 1
- 1:30 â€“ 2:30 pm Â· Breakout Groups (dashboard planning & data exploration)
- 2:30 â€“ 4:00 pm Â· Discussion 2


### Tuesday, September 23
- 12:00 â€“ 1:30 pm Â· Discussion 3
- 1:30 â€“ 2:30 pm Â· Breakout Groups (building & iterating on your dashboard)
- 2:30 â€“ 4:00 pm Â· Discussion 4 and project showcases

## Project Focus

Across both days you will scope, build, and present a custom financial dashboard:

1. Identify a question or analysis that matters to you or your team.
2. Use WRDS to collect, clean, and validate the underlying data.
3. Prototype visualizations that surface the key findings.
4. Assemble the final interactive dashboard in Streamlit and publish it locally, with optional guidance for hosting on the web.

Expect plenty of instructor feedback during the breakout blocks, plus practical tips on layout, performance, and narrative flow. There will also be room to explore advanced touchesâ€”like scenario toggles or comparison viewsâ€”for teams who move quickly.

## Preparation Checklist

- Install an up-to-date Python environment (Anaconda recommended) and verify Streamlit runs locally with `streamlit hello`.
- Confirm you can log into the WRDS platform ahead of time so we can dive straight into data.
- Bring a laptop, charger, and any prior analysis you might want to showcase.
- Consider a data question you are excited to explore; we will workshop ideas during the opening breakout.
