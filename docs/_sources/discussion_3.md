## Today's Timeline 

### Discussion 3 (12:00 – 1:00 pm)
- **Check-In:** quick check-in on app progress and confirm everyone can log into GitHub.
- **Creating your own GitHub repo:** Follow `creating_new_github_repo.md` to create a new GitHub repo, clone it locally, add the app files, inspect diffs, stage intentionally, and push to `main`.
- **Deployment walkthrough:** Use `deploying_streamlit_app.md` to connect Streamlit Community Cloud to the new repo and note the differences between Community and Pro tiers.
- **Forecast primer:** Walk through `time_series_forecasting` for a quick tour of the Nixtla time series tools and prep results for your Streamlit dashboards.

### Breakout Session (1:00 – 3:00 pm)
- Finish your own analyses and visualizations for your dashboard. 
- Publish your Streamlit app: finish any remaining code edits, push to GitHub, and deploy using the Community Cloud tutorial.
- Stretch goal: Try your hand at `time_series_forecasting` to experiment with the Nixtla time series forecasting libraries and integrate forecasts into your dashboard.

### Regroup for Discussion 4 (3:00 pm)
- Arrive with your deployed app link (or a local demo plan) and be ready to share the asset class you explored, the key visual insight you found, and one technical hurdle you overcame.
- Network with your peers! Find new friends and collaborators with similar interests.
