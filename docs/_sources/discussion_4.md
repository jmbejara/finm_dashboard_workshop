# Discussion 4 – Showcase & Community

**Goal:** celebrate the work, surface insights from each dashboard, and build connections across asset-class interest areas.

## Schedule (3:00 – 4:00 pm)
- **3:00 – 3:10 · Set the stage:** quick reminders about presentation flow (2–3 minute demo + 2 minutes of Q&A).
- **3:10 – 3:45 · Lightning demos:** teams share their Streamlit app links, briefly describe the asset class explored, highlight one compelling visualization, and call out a forecasting or data hurdle they tackled.
- **3:45 – 4:00 · Networking circle:** break into clusters by asset class or technique (e.g., equities, credit, FX, forecasting) to swap lessons and potential next steps.

## Presenter Checklist
- Deployment link (or local fallback) ready in a browser tab.
- Talking points rehearsed: objective, dataset, visualization story, and what you would iterate on next.
- Backup screenshots saved in case Wi-Fi lags.
- Open questions for the room—what feedback or collaboration do you want?

## Audience Prompts
- What stood out about the data story? Was the visualization intuitive?
- How might the forecasting component extend or challenge the narrative?
- Are there features or datasets you’d recommend the presenter explore next?

## Wrap-Up Actions
- Share your repo and deployment links with the cohort so everyone can continue exploring.
- Jot down any takeaways or resources from the networking circle and add them to the class Slack/Canvas thread.
- Reflect individually: what will you build or research next with these tools?
